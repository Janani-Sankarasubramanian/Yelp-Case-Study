# Yelp-Case-Study
This project is mainly focused on restaurants in Toronto. I have analyzed the factors that go into running a successful restaurant business. This study is aimed at helping low-rated restaurants turn their businesses into successful ones. I do so, by analyzing large datasets of popular restaurants based on high-quality reviews and try and identify some of the common underlying factors that go into making them successful. I then try and suggest these factors to poorly performing restaurants to help them improve their business. While I avoid some major pointers such as more investment or better quality of food (which is primarily one of the reasons), I evaluate other attributes of a successful restaurant business such as the amenities offered, food delivery services, variety of cuisines etc.
